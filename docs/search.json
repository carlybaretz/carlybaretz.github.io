(Print the answer to the screen, show the R code which is your work, and write a complete sentence with the answer.)\nHow many variables are there for each pet? What are the names of the variables? Again, show your work using R code (not the Viewer or the Environment) and write a complete sentence.\nWhat are the three most common pet names in Seattle? (You’ll need to use the function n() which counts the number of rows.)\n\n\n\nQuestion 10\n\nWhat are the three most common names for each of the cat and dog species? Your initial code may only tell you about dogs (and the poor unnamed kitties). The slice_ family of functions pulls out a specified number of rows. For example, slice_min() pulls out the smallest rows, slice_max() pulls out the largest rows, slice_head() pulls out the first row, … (see the cheatsheets! https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).\nI’ve added a new column to the dataset which gives the proportion of a particular species with the given name. Create a scatterplot of the 20 most popular pet names (as measured by the max proportion of the species with that name - the value calculated below).

The p-value indicates the proportion of permuted differences that exceed the observed difference, and the histogram visualizes this distribution, with a red line marking the observed difference for comparison.\nIn this analysis, I conducted a permutation test to determine if there is a significant difference in average salary between pitchers on the Mets and Yankees using the mlb dataset from the openintro package. First, I calculated the observed difference in average salary of pitchers between the two teams. Then, I defined a permutation function that randomly shuffles the salaries across teams to simulate the null hypothesis, calculating the difference in mean salary for each permutation. Finally, I repeated this process 500 times to build a distribution of permuted differences, compared the observed difference to this distribution, and computed a p-value to assess significance, visualizing the results in a histogram.\nPitchers on the Mets have a higher average salary than pitchers on the Yankees by about $2,548,385.\nHowever, the p-value of 0.198 from the permutation test suggests that this difference isn’t statistically significant. In other words, the observed difference could reasonably occur by chance in about 20% of random permutations. So, while the Mets pitchers have a slightly higher average salary in this dataset, we don’t have strong evidence to conclude that this difference is meaningful or consistent.\n*In the dataset, salaries are represented in thousands. For example, a value of 400 corresponds to a salary of $400,000, and a value of 20144 represents $20,144,000.\nThis dataset came from the openintro package, mlb. “Salary data for Major League Baseball (2010)” https://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/mlb.html"

The subjects returned for four to eight sessions. Measurements were made at three ear-canal locations: a deep insertion depth (with a foam plug flush at the entrance to the ear canal) and both 3 and 6 mm more lateral to this deep insertion.\n\n\n Study sample: Repeated measurements on seven subjects are reported. All subjects were female, between 19 and 22 yr old, and enrolled at an undergraduate women’s college.\n\n\n Data collection and analysis:  Measurements on both the right and left ears were made at three ear-canal locations during each of four to eight measurement sessions. Random-effects regression models were used for the analysis to account for repeated measures within subjects. The mean power reflectance for each position over all sessions was calculated for each subject.\n\n\n Results:  The comparison of power reflectance from the left and right ears of an individual subject varied greatly over the seven subjects; the difference between the power reflectance measured on the left and that measured on the right was compared at 248 frequencies, and depending on the subject, the percentage of tested frequencies for which the left and right ears differed significantly ranged from 10% to 93% (some with left values greater than right values and others with the opposite pattern). Although the individual subjects showed left-right differences, the overall population generally did not show significant differences between the left and right ears. The mean power reflectance for each measurement position over all sessions depended on the location of the probe in the ear for frequencies of less than 1000 Hz. The standard deviation between subjects’ mean power reflectance after controlling for ear (left or right) was found to be greater than the standard deviation within the individual subject’s mean power reflectance. The intrasubject standard deviation in power reflectance was smallest at the deepest insertion depths.\n\n\n Conclusions:  All subjects had differences in power reflectance between their left and right ears at some frequencies; the percentage of frequencies at which differences occurred varied greatly across subjects. The intrasubject standard deviations were smallest for the deepest probe insertion depths, suggesting clinical measurements should be made with as deep an insertion as practically possible to minimize variability. This deep insertion will reduce both acoustic leaks and the effect of low-frequency ear-canal losses. The within-subject standard deviations were about half the magnitude of the overall standard deviations, quantifying the extent of intrasubject versus intersubject variability.\n\n” |Susan Voss |svoss@smith.edu |24-Aug-2016 |Measurements made on 7 subjects across multiple sessions and 3 probe locations for each subject.

J. Pediatr. Otorhinolaryngol. |https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23047065/ |\n\n Objective:  Presently, normative wideband reflectance data are available for neonates who have passed a distortion product otoacoustic emission test. However, passing the distortion product otoacoustic emission test alone does not ensure normal middle ear function. The objective of this study was to establish normative wideband reflectance data in healthy neonates with normal middle ear function, as justified by passing a battery of tests.\n\n\n Method:  Wideband reflectance was measured in 66 infants (mean age=46.0 h, SD=21.0, range=13.3-116.5h) who passed a test battery that included high frequency (1000 Hz) tympanometry, acoustic stapedial reflex, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and distortion product otoacoustic emissions.\n\n\n Results:  The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results showed significant variations of reflectance across the frequencies. There was no significant difference between ears and genders. The median reflectance reached a minimum of 0.21-0.24 at 1-2 kHz, but increased to 0.45-0.59 below 1 kHz and 0.24-0.52 above 2 kHz.\n\n\n Conclusions:  The normative reflectance data established in the present study were in agreement with, but marginally smaller than, those of previous normative studies, except for the Keefe et al. (2000) study. While the use of a test battery approach to ensure normal middle ear function in neonates has resulted in slightly reduced reflectance across most frequencies when compared to studies that have used only otoacoustic emissions, further research is needed to accurately determine the middle ear status of neonates using test performance measures.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |Sreedevi Aithal   |Sreedevi.aithal@health.qld.gov.au |2-Jan-2023    |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|Aithal_2014 | 2014|Sreedevi Aithal, Joseph Kei, and Carlie Driscoll |Aithal et al. |Wideband Absorbance in Young Infants (0–6 months): A Cross-Sectional Study |J Am Acad Audiol |https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25257721/ |\n\n Background:  Wideband acoustic immittance (WAI) studies on infants have shown changes in WAI measures with age. These changes are attributed, at least in part, to developmental effects. However, developmental effects in young infants (0-6 mo) on WAI have not been systematically investigated.\n\n\n Purpose:  The objective of this study was to compare wideband absorbance (WBA) in healthy neonates and infants aged 1, 2, 4, and 6 mo.\n\n\n Research Design:  This was a prospective cross-sectional study. All participants were assessed by using 1-kHz tympanometry, distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) tests, and WBA tests.\n\n\n Study Sample  Participants included 35 newborns (35 ears), 16 infants aged 1 mo (29 ears), 16 infants aged 2 mo (29 ears), 15 infants aged 4 mo (28 ears), and 14 infants aged 6 mo (27 ears). For each participant, the ears that passed both high-frequency (1-kHz) tympanometry and DPOAE tests were included for analysis.\n\n\n Data collection and analysis:  WBA was recorded at ambient pressure conditions, and the response consisted of 16 data points at 1/3-octave frequencies from 0.25 to 8 kHz. A mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to the data in each age group to evaluate the effects of sex, ear, and frequency on WBA. WBA was compared between various age groups. In addition, a separate mixed-model ANOVA was applied to WBA data, and post hoc analyses with the Bonferroni correction were performed at each of the 16 data points at 1/3-octave frequencies across age groups to examine the effect of age on WBA.\n\n\n Results:  For all age groups, WBA was highest between 1.5 and 5 kHz and lowest at frequencies of less than 1.5 kHz and greater than 5 kHz. A developmental trend was evident, with both the 0- and 6-mo-old infants being significantly different from other age groups at most frequencies. The WBA results exhibited a multipeaked pattern for infants aged 0 to 2 mo, whereas a single broad peaked pattern for 4- and 6-mo-old infants was observed. The difference in WBA between 0- and 6-mo-old infants was statistically significant across most frequencies. In contrast, the WBA results for 1- and 2-mo-old infants were comparable. There were no significant sex or ear effects on WBA for all age groups.\n\n\n Conclusions:  Developmental effects of WBA were evident for infants during the first 6 mo of life. The WBA data can be used as a reference for detecting disorders in the sound-conductive pathways (outer and middle ear) in young infants. Further development of age-specific normative WBA data in young infants is warranted.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |Sreedevi Aithal   |Sreedevi.aithal@health.qld.gov.au |2-Jan-2023    |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|Aithal_2014b | 2014|Sreedevi Aithal, Joseph Kei, and Carlie Driscoll |Aithal et al. |Wideband Absorbance in Australian Aboriginal and Caucasian Neonates |J Am Acad Audiol |https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25257722 |\n\n Background:  Despite the high prevalence of otitis media in Australian Aboriginal infants and children, the conductive mechanism of the outer and middle ear of Aboriginal neonates remains unclear. Differences in characteristics of the conductive pathway (outer and middle ear) between Aboriginal and Caucasian neonates have not been systematically investigated by using wideband acoustic immittance measures.\n\n\n Purpose:  The objective of this study was to compare wideband absorbance (WBA) in Australian Aboriginal and Caucasian neonates who passed or failed a screening test battery containing high-frequency tympanometry and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs).\n\n\n Research Design:  A cross-sectional study design was used. The mean WBA as a function of frequency was compared between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal neonates who passed or failed the test battery.\n\n\n Study Sample:  A total of 59 ears from 32 Aboriginal neonates (mean age, 51.9 h; standard deviation [SD], 18.2 h; range, 22–86 h) and 281 ears from 158 Caucasian neonates (mean age, 42.4 h; SD, 23.0 h; range, 8.1–152 h) who passed or failed 1000-Hz tympanometry and DPOAEs were included in the study.\n\n\n Data Collection and Analysis:    WBAresults were analyzed by using descriptive statistics and t tests with Bonferroni adjustment. An analysis of variance with repeated measures was applied to the data.\n\n\n Results:  Aboriginal and Caucasian neonates had almost identical pass rates of 61%, as determined by the test battery. Despite the apparently equal pass rates, the mean WBA of Aboriginal neonates who passed the test battery was significantly lower than that of their Caucasian counterparts at frequencies between 0.4 and 2 kHz. The mean WBA of Aboriginal neonates who failed the test battery was significantly lower than that of their Caucasian counterparts who also failed the test battery at frequencies between 1.5 and 3 kHz. Both Aboriginal and Caucasian neonates who failed the test battery had significantly lower WBA values than their counterparts who passed the test battery.\n\n\n Conclusions:  This study provided convincing evidence that Aboriginal neonates had significantly lower WBA values than their Caucasian counterparts, although both groups had equal pass rates, as determined by the test battery. Although the two ethnic groups showed significant differences in WBA, the factors contributing to such differences remain undetermined. Further research is warranted to determine the factors that might account for the difference in WBA between the two ethnic groups.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |Sreedevi Aithal   |Sreedevi.aithal@health.qld.gov.au |26-Feb-2023   |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|Aithal_2015 | 2015|Sreedevi Aithal, Joseph Kei, Carlie Driscoll, Asaduzzaman Khan, and Andrew Swanston |Aithal et al. |Wideband Absorbance Outcomes in Newborns: A Comparison With High-Frequency Tympanometry, Automated Brainstem Response, and Transient Evoked and Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions |Ear Hear |https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25951046/ |\n\n Objectives:  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the test performance of wideband absorbance (WBA) in terms of its ability to predict the outer and middle ear status as determined by nine reference standards.\n\n\n Design:  Automated auditory brainstem response (AABR), high-frequency (1000 Hz) tympanometry (HFT), transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE), and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) tests were performed on 298 ears (144 right, 154 left) of 192 (108 males, 84 females) neonates with a mean age of 43.7 hours (SD = 21.3, range = 8.3 to 152.2 hr). WBA was measured from 0.25 to 8 kHz using clicks under ambient pressure conditions. Test performance of WBA was assessed in terms of its ability to identify conductive conditions in neonates when compared with nine reference standards (including four single tests and five test batteries) using the receiver operating characteristic analysis.\n\n\n Results:  The test performance of WBA against the test battery reference standards was better than that against single test reference standards. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve reached a high value of 0.78 for HFT + TEOAE + DPOAE and AABR + TEOAE + DPOAE reference standards. Within the ears that passed each of the reference standards, there were no significant differences in WBA. However, for the ears that failed each of the test standards, there were significant differences in WBA. The region between 1 and 4 kHz provided the best discriminability to evaluate the conductive status compared with other frequencies.\n\n\n Conclusions:  WBA is a desirable measure of conductive conditions in newborns due to its high performance in classifying ears with conductive loss as determined by the best performing surrogate gold standards (HFT + TEOAE + DPOAE and AABR + TEOAE + DPOAE).\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |Sreedevi Aithal   |Sreedevi.Aithal@health.qld.gov.au |26-Feb-2023   |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|Aithal_2017a | 2017|Sreedevi Aithal, Joseph Kei, Venkatesh Aithal, Alehandrea Manuel, Joshua Myers, Carlie Driscoll, and Asaduzzaman Khanb |Aithal et al. |Normative Study of Wideband Acoustic Immittance Measures in Newborn Infants |J Speech Lang Hear Res |https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28395306 |\n\n Objective:  The purpose of this study was to describe normative aspects of wideband acoustic immittance (WAI) measures obtained from healthy White neonates.\n\n\n Method:  In this cross-sectional study, wideband absorbance (WBA), admittance magnitude, and admittance phase were measured under ambient pressure condition in 326 ears from 203 neonates (M age = 45.9 hr) who passed a battery of tests, including automated auditory brainstem response, high-frequency tympanometry, and distortion product otoacoustic emissions.\n\n\n Results:  Normative WBA data were in agreement with most previous studies. Normative data for both WBA and admittance magnitude revealed double-peaked patterns with the 1st peak at 1.25–2 kHz and the 2nd peak at 5–8 kHz, while normative admittance phase data showed 2 peaks at 0.8 and 4 kHz. There were no significant differences between ears or gender for the 3 WAI measures. Standard deviations for all 3 measures were highest at frequencies above 4 kHz.\n\n\n Conclusions:  The 3 WAI measures between 1 kHz and 4 kHz may provide the most stable response of the outer and middle ear.

The variation in WBA below 0.5 kHz, as the pressure was varied, was the greatest in newborns. But, the variation was progressively reduced in older infants up to the age of 6 months, suggesting stiffening of the ear canal with age.\n\n\n Conclusions:  Significant changes in WBA were observed as a function of pressure and age. In particular, developmental effects on WBA were evident during the first six months of life.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |Sreedevi Aithal   |Sreedevi.Aithal@health.qld.gov.au |3-May-2023    |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|Aithal_2019a | 2019|Sreedevi Aithal and Venkatesh Aithal and Joseph Kei and Shane Anderson and Simon Liebenberg |Aithal et al. |Eustachian Tube Dysfunction and Wideband Absorbance Measurements at Tympanometric Peak Pressure and 0 daPa |J Am Acad Audiol |https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30424833/ |\n\n Background:  Although wideband absorbance (WBA) provides important information about middle ear function, there is limited research on the use of WBA to evaluate eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD). To date, WBA obtained under pressurized condition has not been used to evaluate ETD.\n\n\n Purpose:  The objective of the study was to compare WBA at 0 daPa and tympanometric peak pressure (TPP) conditions in healthy ears and ears with ETD.\n\n\n Research Design:  A cross-sectional study design was used.\n\n\n Study Sample:  A total of 102 healthy ears from 79 participants (mean age = 10.0 yr) and 43 ears from 32 patients with ETD (mean age = 16.0 yr) were included in this cross-sectional study. WBA was measured at 0 daPa (WBAo) and TPP WBA at TPP (WBATPP).\n\n\n Data collection and analysis:  WBA results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and t-tests with the Bonferroni correction. An analysis of variance with repeated measures was applied to the data.\n\n\n Results:  WBAo was significantly lower in the ETD group than in the control group. The WBAo of the control group demonstrated a broad peak between 1.25 and 4 kHz, whereas the WBAo of the ETD group had a peak between 2.5 and 4 kHz. WBATPP of the ETD group approached values close to that of the control group. In the control group, WBATPP was only 0.06 to 0.09 higher than WBAo, whereas in the ETD group, WBATPP was 0.29 to 0.42 higher than WBAo between 0.6 and 1.5 kHz. A differential pattern of WBA at TPP relative to 0 daPa was observed between ears with ETD and ears with otitis media with effusion (OME) and negative middle ear pressure (NMEP).\n\n\n Conclusions:  Hence, a comparison of WBAo and WBATPP can provide potentially useful diagnostic information, and hence can be used as an adjunct tool to evaluate ETD. This is important especially in young children or some adults who are unable to perform maneuvers such as Toynbee or Valsalva during ETD assessment. Further research is needed to verify the results using test performance measures to determine whether WBAo and WBATPP can objectively determine the presence of ETD or OME with NMEP.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |Sreedevi Aithal   |Sreedevi.Aithal@health.qld.gov.au |26-Feb-2023   |None                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|Aithal_2019b | 2019|Sreedevi Aithal, Venkatesh Aithal, Joseph Kei,and Alehandrea Manuela |Aithal et al. |Effect of Negative Middle Ear Pressure and Compensated Pressure on Wideband Absorbance and Otoacoustic Emissions in Children |J Speech Lang Hear Res |https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31437100/ |Objective This study investigated pressurized transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) responses and wideband absorbance (WBA) in healthy ears and ears with negative middle ear pressure (NMEP). Method In this cross-sectional study, TEOAE amplitude, signal-to-noise ratio, and WBA were measured at ambient and tympanometric peak pressure (TPP) in 36 ears from 25 subjects with healthy ears (age range: 3.1-13.0 years) and 88 ears from 76 patients with NMEP (age range: 2.0-13.1 years), divided into 3 groups based on NMEP (Group 1 with TPP between -101 and -200 daPa, Group 2 with TPP between -201 and -300 daPa, and Group 3 with TPP between -301 and -400 daPa). Results Mean TEOAE amplitude, signal-to-noise ratio, and WBA were increased at TPP relative to that measured at ambient pressure between 0.8 and 1.5 kHz. Further decrease in TPP beyond -300 daPa did not result in further increases in the mean TEOAE or WBA at TPP. The correlation between TEOAE and WBA was dependent on the frequency, pressure conditions, and subject group. There was no difference in pass rates between the 2 pressure conditions for the control group, while the 3 NMEP groups demonstrated an improvement in pass rates at TPP. With pressurization, the false alarm rate for TEOAE due to NMEP was reduced by 17.8% for NMEP Group 1, 29.2% for NMEP Group 2, and 15.8% for NMEP Group 3. Conclusion Results demonstrated the feasibility and clinical benefits of measuring TEOAE and WBA under pressurized conditions. Pressurized TEOAE and WBA should be used for assessment of ears with NMEP in hearing screening programs to reduce false alarm rates. |Sreedevi Aithal |Sreedevi.Aithal@health.qld.gov.au |17-Apr-2023 | | |Aithal_2020a | 2020|Sreedevi Aithal, Venkatesh Aithal, Joseph Kei, and Matthew Wilson |Aithal et al. |Predictive Accuracy of Wideband Absorbance at Ambient and Tympanometric Peak Pressure Conditions in Identifying Children with Surgically Confirmed Otitis Media with Effusion |J Am Acad Audiol |https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31935192 |\n\n Background:  Wideband absorbance (WBA) measured at ambient pressure (WBAA) does not directly account for middle ear pressure effects. On the other hand, WBA measured at tympanometric peak pressure (TPP) (WBATPP) may compensate for the middle ear pressure effects. To date, there are no studies that have compared WBAA and WBATPP in ears with surgically confirmed otitis media with effusion (OME).\n\n\n Purpose:  The purpose of this study was to compare the predictive accuracy of WBAA and WBATPP in ears with OME.\n\n\n Research Design:  Prospective cross-sectional study.\n\n\n Study Sample:  A total of 60 ears from 38 healthy children (mean age 5 6.5 years, SD 5 1.84 years) and 60 ears from 38 children (mean age 5 5.5 years, SD 5 3.3 years) with confirmed OME during myringotomy were included in this study.\n\n\n Data collection and analysis:  Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and analysis of variance. The predictive accuracy of WBAA and WBATPP was determined using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses.\n\n\n Results:  Both WBAA and WBATPP were reduced in ears with OME compared with that in healthy ears. The area under the ROC (AROC) curve was 0.92 for WBAA at 1.5 kHz, whereas that for WBATPP at 1.25 kHz was 0.91. In comparison, the AROC for 226-Hz tympanometry based on the static acoustic admittance (Ytm) measure was 0.93.\n\n\n Conclusions:  Both WBAA and WBATPP showed high and similar test performance, but neither test performed significantly better than 226-Hz tympanometry for detection of surgically confirmed OME.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |Sreedevi Aithal   |Sreedevi.Aithal@health.qld.gov.au |24-Apr-2023   |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\n:::\n\nSELECT * FROM PI_Info \nWHERE Identifier = \"Abur_2014\"; \n\n\n1 records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifier\nYear\nAuthors\nAuthorsShortList\nTitle\nJournal\nURL\nAbstract\nDataSubmitterName\nDataSubmitterEmail\nDateSubmitted\nPI_Notes\n\n\n\n\nAbur_2014\n2014\nDefne Abur, Nicholas J.

The subjects returned for four to eight sessions. Measurements were made at three ear-canal locations: a deep insertion depth (with a foam plug flush at the entrance to the ear canal) and both 3 and 6 mm more lateral to this deep insertion.\n\n\n Study sample: Repeated measurements on seven subjects are reported. All subjects were female, between 19 and 22 yr old, and enrolled at an undergraduate women’s college.\n\n\n Data collection and analysis:  Measurements on both the right and left ears were made at three ear-canal locations during each of four to eight measurement sessions. Random-effects regression models were used for the analysis to account for repeated measures within subjects. The mean power reflectance for each position over all sessions was calculated for each subject.\n\n\n Results:  The comparison of power reflectance from the left and right ears of an individual subject varied greatly over the seven subjects; the difference between the power reflectance measured on the left and that measured on the right was compared at 248 frequencies, and depending on the subject, the percentage of tested frequencies for which the left and right ears differed significantly ranged from 10% to 93% (some with left values greater than right values and others with the opposite pattern). Although the individual subjects showed left-right differences, the overall population generally did not show significant differences between the left and right ears. The mean power reflectance for each measurement position over all sessions depended on the location of the probe in the ear for frequencies of less than 1000 Hz. The standard deviation between subjects’ mean power reflectance after controlling for ear (left or right) was found to be greater than the standard deviation within the individual subject’s mean power reflectance. The intrasubject standard deviation in power reflectance was smallest at the deepest insertion depths.\n\n\n Conclusions:  All subjects had differences in power reflectance between their left and right ears at some frequencies; the percentage of frequencies at which differences occurred varied greatly across subjects. The intrasubject standard deviations were smallest for the deepest probe insertion depths, suggesting clinical measurements should be made with as deep an insertion as practically possible to minimize variability. This deep insertion will reduce both acoustic leaks and the effect of low-frequency ear-canal losses. The within-subject standard deviations were about half the magnitude of the overall standard deviations, quantifying the extent of intrasubject versus intersubject variability.\n\n” |Susan Voss |svoss@smith.edu |24-Aug-2016 |Measurements made on 7 subjects across multiple sessions and 3 probe locations for each subject. Database includes measurements at only the deepest insertion depth (Position 1) and Channel B only. |\n\n\n\nSELECT * FROM Measurements \nWHERE Identifier = \"Abur_2014\"; \n\n\nDisplaying records 1 - 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifier\nSubjectNumber\nSession\nEar\nInstrument\nAge\nAgeCategory\nEarStatus\nTPP\nAreaCanal\nPressureCanal\nSweepDirection\nFrequency\nAbsorbance\nZmag\nZang\n\n\n\n\nAbur_2014\n1\n1\nLeft\nHearID\n20\nAdult\nNormal\n-5\n4.42e-05\n0\nAmbient\n210.938\n0.0333379\n113780000\n-0.233504\n\n\nAbur_2014\n1\n1\nLeft\nHearID\n20\nAdult\nNormal\n-5\n4.42e-05\n0\nAmbient\n234.375\n0.0315705\n103585000\n-0.235778\n\n\nAbur_2014\n1\n1\nLeft\nHearID\n20\nAdult\nNormal\n-5\n4.42e-05\n0\nAmbient\n257.812\n0.0405751\n92951696\n-0.233482\n\n\nAbur_2014\n1\n1\nLeft\nHearID\n20\nAdult\nNormal\n-5\n4.42e-05\n0\nAmbient\n281.250\n0.0438399\n86058000\n-0.233421\n\n\nAbur_2014\n1\n1\nLeft\nHearID\n20\nAdult\nNormal\n-5\n4.42e-05\n0\nAmbient\n304.688\n0.0486400\n79492800\n-0.232931\n\n\nAbur_2014\n1\n1\nLeft\nHearID\n20\nAdult\nNormal\n-5\n4.42e-05\n0\nAmbient\n328.125\n0.0527801\n73326200\n-0.232837\n\n\nAbur_2014\n1\n1\nLeft\nHearID\n20\nAdult\nNormal\n-5\n4.42e-05\n0\nAmbient\n351.562\n0.0583192\n68793600\n-0.232115\n\n\nAbur_2014\n1\n1\nLeft\nHearID\n20\nAdult\nNormal\n-5\n4.42e-05\n0\nAmbient\n375.000\n0.0638881\n64088600\n-0.231642\n\n\nAbur_2014\n1\n1\nLeft\nHearID\n20\nAdult\nNormal\n-5\n4.42e-05\n0\nAmbient\n398.438\n0.0687025\n60200600\n-0.231356\n\n\nAbur_2014\n1\n1\nLeft\nHearID\n20\nAdult\nNormal\n-5\n4.42e-05\n0\nAmbient\n421.875\n0.0833181\n56990900\n-0.228356\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT Identifier, Frequency, LOG10(Frequency) AS log_frequency,  AVG(Absorbance) AS mean_absorbance \nFROM Measurements\nWHERE Identifier IN (\"Abur_2014\", \"Feeney_2017\", \"Groon_2015\" ,\"Lewis_2015\", \"Liu_2008\"\n\"Rosowski_2012\", \"Shahnaz_2006\", \"Shaver_2013\" , \"Sun_2016\", \"Voss_1994\", \"Voss_2010\", \"Werner_2010\" ) AND Frequency &gt;
